            This section will tell you roughly what will be described in the following parts. We are not talking about climate change in one region, but rather about temperature changes and their impact on the weather on a global scale.

                        In general terms, the average global temperature is rising. We call this global warming.The response that produces global warming is generally referred to as the greenhouse effect.An explanation of the greenhouse effect in Wikipedia reads: "The greenhouse
                        effect is the process by which radiation from a planet's atmosphere warms the planet's surface to a temperature above what it would be without this atmosphere. Radiatively active gases (i.e., greenhouse gases) in a planet's atmosphere
                        radiate energy in all directions. Part of this radiation is directed towards the surface, thus warming it. The intensity of downward radiation – that is, the strength of the greenhouse effect – depends on the amount of greenhouse
                        gases that the atmosphere contains. The temperature rises until the intensity of upward radiation from the surface, thus cooling it, balances the downward energy flow."

                        Generally speaking, climate change caused by natural factors is much smaller than that caused by human factors. This is because the development of industry and other industries produces far more greenhouse effects than natural factors.Most of the natural
                        causes that cause the greenhouse effect do not occur very frequently.

                        around the 1950s. From the end of the twentieth century to 2014, the annual temperature differences were mostly positive integers. This means that temperatures continued to increase during that period.The rate of rasing of global
                        average temperature is also increased.In the WMO article it was written that:<br/> "Average global air temperatures over land and sea surface in 2014 were 0.57 °C (1.03°F) above the long-term average of 14.00°C (57.2 °F) for the

                        effect must cause the temperature to be abnormally high.It is also written in the NOAA report that :
                        <br/>"The global land-only surface temperature for July 2021 was 1.40°C (2.52°F) above the 20th-century average — the highest July land-only surface temperature on record, surpassing the previous record set in 2017, and again in
                        2020, by 0.17°C (0.31°F). The warmth across the global land surfaces was mainly driven by higher than normal temperatures across much of the Northern Hemisphere land, which also had its highest July temperature at 1.54°C (2.77°F),
                        exceeding the now second warmest July set in 2012 by 0.19°C (0.34°F). Overall, the Northern Hemisphere land and ocean surface had its second warmest July on record at +1.14°C (+2.05°F). This was only 0.06°C (0.11°F) shy of tying
                        the record warm July of 2020."

                        There is a strong relationship between the change in temperature and the change in carbon dioxide.We can find the relevant article in the NOAA report:<br/> "One of the most remarkable aspects of the paleoclimate record is the strong
                        correspondence between temperature and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere observed during the glacial cycles of the past several hundred thousand years. When the carbon dioxide concentration goes up, temperature
                        goes up. When the carbon dioxide concentration goes down, temperature goes down. A small part of the correspondence is due to the relationship between temperature and the solubility of carbon dioxide in the surface ocean, but the
                        majority of the correspondence is consistent with a feedback between carbon dioxide and climate."

                        Anthropogenic increases in carbon emissions have increased significantly since the last century. The development of industry, for example, has resulted in the emission of large amounts of waste gases. This has led to a significant increase in anthropogenic
                        emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases compared to the amount emitted before the start of industry .As we can clearly see from the picture on the right, around the middle of the 20th century the world's CO2 emissions
                        began to increase by leaps and bounds.And with the global population boom of recent decades, the amount of CO2 exhaled by all people alone is a huge amount.With the development of different industries, items that emit emissions,
                        such as cars, are becoming more and more common. The large number of these items also generates a proportion of CO2 emissions.

                        First of all we need to be clear about one idea: <br/>"The greenhouse effect is not bad in itself, the abnormal greenhouse effect and its effects that are bad.The natural factors actually emits much more carbon dioxide and greenhouse
                        gases naturally than humans do."
                        <br/>As an example, the huge number of cattle in the world emit an unbelievably large amount of greenhouse gases every day. In fact, the large amounts of carbon dioxide emitted daily by all humans and animals around the world by
                        breathing can also be classified as a natural factor. This is because breathing is a physiological activity that must be done in order to survive. Before human intervention, the planet's carbon emissions and 'Carbon sink' were
                        in balance. We can find a description and pictures of this in Wikipedia ：
                        <br/><br/> " A carbon sink is any reservoir, natural or otherwise, that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period and thereby lowers the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) from
                        the atmosphere. Globally, the two most important carbon sinks are vegetation and the ocean. Public awareness of the significance of CO2 sinks has grown since passage of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which promotes their use as a form
                        of carbon offset.There are also different strategies used to enhance this process. Soil is an important carbon storage medium. Much of the organic carbon retained in the soil of agricultural areas has been depleted due to intensive
                        farming. "Blue carbon" designates carbon that is fixed via the ocean ecosystems. Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses make up a majority of ocean plant life and store large quantities of carbon. Many efforts are being made to
                        enhancing natural sequestration in soils and the oceans. In addition, a range of artificial sequestration initiatives are underway such as changed building construction materials, carbon capture and storage and geological sequestration."

            can increase mortality, impact food availability, and limit worker productivity. Climate change impacts are seen throughout every aspect of the world we live in. However, climate change impacts are uneven across the country and the world —
            even within a single community, climate change impacts can differ between neighborhoods or individuals. Long-standing socioeconomic inequities can make underserved groups, who often have the highest exposure to hazards and the fewest resources
            to respond, more vulnerable. "

                <tr>
                    <td class="table_in_Impact" width=1000px>The article above gives a general statement about the effects of climate change. In this paragraph we will mainly talk about its impact on humans themselves. Its worst effects are still those concerning human health. An excerpt from
                        the NOAA article has a paragraph that reads:<br/><br/> " Climate change is already impacting human health. Changes in weather and climate patterns can put lives at risk. Heat is one of the most deadly weather phenomena. As ocean
                        temperatures rise, hurricanes are getting stronger and wetter, which can cause direct and indirect deaths. Dry conditions lead to more wildfires, which bring many health risks. Higher incidences of flooding can lead to the spread
                        of waterborne diseases, injuries, and chemical hazards. As geographic ranges of mosquitoes and ticks expand, they can carry diseases to new locations.<br/> The most vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, people with
                        preexisting health conditions, outdoor workers, people of color, and people with low income, are at an even higher risk because of the compounding factors from climate change. But public health groups can work with local communities
                        to help people understand and build resilience to climate change health impacts."

                        Climate change will have a major impact on ecosystems and organisms. The Arctic is one of the most vulnerable places to receive the effects of climate change. Global warming has caused some of the Arctic's glaciers to heat up and melt. The melting of
                        Arctic glaciers will not only damage the Arctic ecosystem itself but will also cause a number of problems as global sea levels rise.<br/> A large part of the effects of climate change will also act on the
                        oceans. The ocean is the world's largest reservoir of carbon dioxide. It absorbs around 30% of CO2 emissions. This is causing the sea to become more and more acidic. This can greatly damage the ecology of the oceans and greatly
                        affect marine life.<br/> In addition to this, the abnormal climate may increase the frequency of extreme weather events. For example, droughts, floods and other disasters. This can greatly endanger the survival of living organisms.

                        The main cause of human-induced climate change and the greenhouse effect comes from human emissions of greenhouse gases.Because humans need to develop projects such as industry, there are significant emissions throughout the process.Large amounts of fossil
                        fuels are burned and emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. So to improve the abnormal greenhouse effect and global warming we need to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by industry and other
                        causes.In order to achieve this goal while allowing society to continue to develop, replacing fossil fuels with other energy sources could be a good option. Energy from sources such as solar power, water power and wind power are
                        all good choices. The use of these sources of energy has a much lower impact on the greenhouse effect.So for most people, the best way to help improve the greenhouse effect is to try to use these sources of energy rather than fossil
                        fuels.

                        In the last paragraph of the section "Human Factors and Natural Factors" we learn that nature itself has a balanced greenhouse effect. So we can start to improve the greenhouse effect in this respect. Nature itself has a relatively complete system of
                        greenhouse effects - an effect that humans call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sink" target="_blank" title="turn to WIKI">carbon sink</a> . So we can improve the natural environment, such
                        as planting trees and improving the marine environment, in order to enhance carbon sinks. A sufficiently good marine environment and an abundance of forests would significantly increase the planet's efficiency in dealing with greenhouse
                        gases. And through carbon sinks, they can separate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thereby improving global warming.
